Rule
1.	You have two full days to implement a solution.
2.	We are really, really interested in your object oriented or functional design skills, so please craft the most beautiful code you can.
3.	We’re also interested in understanding how you make assumptions when building software. If a particular workflow or boundary condition is not defined in the problem statement below, what you do is your choice.
4.	You have to solve the problem in Java language without using any external libraries to the core language except for a testing library for TDD
5.	Please use Git for version control. We expect you to send us a standard zip or tarball of your source code when you're done that includes Git metadata (the .git folder) in the tarball so we can look at your commit logs and understand how your solution evolved
6.	Please ensure that you follow the syntax and formatting of both the input and output samples. The zip file you have been sent includes the same automated functional test suite we use. This is to help you validate the correctness of your program. You can run it by invoking bin/run_functional_tests. IMPORTANT: To make the functional specs work correctly, some setup is needed. Instructions to set up the functional suite can be found under functional_spec/README.md.
Problem Statement
I own a parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time. Each slot is
given a number starting at 1 increasing with increasing distance from the entry point
in steps of one. I want to create an automated ticketing system that allows my
customers to use my parking lot without human intervention.
When a car enters my parking lot, I want to have a ticket issued to the driver. The
ticket issuing process includes us documenting the registration number (number
plate) and the colour of the car and allocating an available parking slot to the car
before actually handing over a ticket to the driver (we assume that our customers are
nice enough to always park in the slots allocated to them). The customer should be
allocated a parking slot which is nearest to the entry. At the exit the customer returns
the ticket with the time the car was parked in the lot, which then marks the slot they
were using as being available. Total parking charge should be calculated as per the
parking time. Charge applicable is $10 for first 2 hours and $10 for every additional
hour.
We interact with the system via a simple set of commands which produce a specific
output. Please take a look at the example below, which includes all the commandsyou need to support - they're self explanatory. The system should accept a filename
as a parameter at the command prompt and read the commands from that file.

Example: File
To install all dependencies, compile and run tests:
$ bin/setup
To run the code so it accepts input from a file:
$ bin/parking_lot file_inputs.txt
Commands
•	Create parking lot of size n : create_parking_lot {capacity}
•	Park a car : park {car_number}
•	Remove(Unpark) car from : leave {car_number} {hours}
•	Print status of parking slot : status

Input (contents of file):
create_parking_lot 6

park KA-01-HH-9999
park KA-01-BB-0001
